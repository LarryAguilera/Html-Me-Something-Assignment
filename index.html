                <h2>How did we decide on taking a van trip?</h2>
                <p id="firstp">When I was 26 years old I decided to take a van trip alongside my significant other. We were excited and thought that it would be a fun and affordable way to see the united states and so we began planning. 
                Our trip would begin in California and extend all the way to Florida. We planned to make a full circle around the United States, driving north to New York, west to Washington and finishing off back in California, however we soon found out this would be more dificult than we thought.

                <h2>Which van did we choose?</h2>
                <p id="secondp">The van we utilized for this trip was a 1995 Dodge Van 2500. 
                    We chose this car since we found it for sale for $900 USD. The car had a damaged transmition but was in good condition overall. 
                    We decided to get the van fixed in Mexico at a local shop. Since the price of the van was &lt; our budget of $1500 USD we were able to add some extra things to it.</p>

                <h2>Unpredictible situations</h2>
                <p id="thirdp">During a van trip there are multiple things that could go wrong, making it impossible to plan for everything. We had our transmition oil leak causing our car to break down in the middle of Arkansas at around 1:00am. We called AAA to get us towed for 2 hours and drop us off at a nearby mechanic shop, we slept in the car and woke up at the shop to get our car fixed. </p>
